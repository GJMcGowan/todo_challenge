SPA?

Try doing it in Angular, but switch to jquery if that's too difficult.

Don't have to use a database fortunately, can use a data structure (arrays/hash objects presumably)

Need to:
  - Store tasks
  - Add tasks
  - Change tasks
  - Mark tasks as complete
    - Archive, or delete? - Looks like archive.

Optional:
  - Filter by "All", "Active", "Complete"
  - See total tasks
  - Delete all completed tasks

Need unit and feature tests.

Use npm and bower sparingly.
